# Trump Of Yore bot

When Trump tweets, this bot finds the Trump tweet it most closely resembles from before he was president.

## Credits

This project relies heavily on [tweet2vec](https://github.com/bdhingra/tweet2vec), which is described in [this research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03481.pdf) by Dhingra, Bhuwan, Zhong Zhou, Dylan Fitzpatrick, Michael Muehl, and William W. Cohen. "Tweet2Vec: Character-Based Distributed Representations for Social Media." ACL (2016). We **highly** recommend you start with their [original](https://github.com/bdhingra/tweet2vec) code, as we've made a bunch of changes here and have probably broken something.

The project also includes archived tweets by @realDonaldTrump from the Trump Twitter Archive. Check out the [site](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/), the [code(https://github.com/bpb27/trump-tweet-archive)] and the [data](https://github.com/bpb27/trump-tweet-archive/tree/master/data/realdonaldtrump).

The code also uses the Python packages [conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html), [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html), and [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/).
